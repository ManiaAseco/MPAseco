Styles
======

This directory holds window style templates, managed by plugin.style.php.
Templates define the window, header and body background containers, as
well as the header and body text fonts, and the clickable button style.

To create a new template, copy an existing one to a new filename and
edit that, as the existing set will be overwritten in future releases.

Use ManiaLink http://smurf1.free.fr/mle2/index.php
and XML list  http://smurf1.free.fr/mle2/list.php
to select styles and fonts.  Note that not every (sub)style and font
fits everywhere due to size variations.  Also, some layout aspects
are fixed in manialinks.inc.php and cannot be customized easily.

Use <blackcolor> to invert the text highlight color on dark backgrounds.
This color is used to replace any '{#black}' tags in window output.

If you create a nice style template that's sufficiently distinct from
the standard ones, send it to me and I might include it in the next
XAseco2 release. :)
