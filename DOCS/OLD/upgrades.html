<UL>
<LI><u>Upgrading from v0.95 to v0.98</u>:<br><br>
The following files were added in v0.98: dedimania.xml,
plugins/chat.dedimania.php, plugin.dedimania.php.
<br><br>

The following files were updated in v0.98: xaseco2.php, plugins.xml,
includes/replayparser.inc.php, xmlrpc_db.inc.php, web_access.inc.php,
plugins/chat.records2.php, plugin.checkpoints.php, plugin.donate.php,
plugin.map.php, plugin.rasp_chat.php.

<LI>To configure your server for the central Dedimania
database, you must copy the login value in the
<CODE>&lt;masterserver_account&gt;</CODE> section from
your server's dedicated_cfg.txt file into the corresponding
section of the dedimania.xml file.  Further, <A TARGET="_blank"
HREF="http://dedimania.net/tm2stats/?do=register">register your
server</A> with the Dedimania system, generate a DedimaniaCode,
and add that in dedimania.xml as well.
<LI>Open port <b>8082</b> on your firewall/router for communication
with the central Dedimania server.
<LI>In the zip file, all *.XML and *.PHP config files are located
inside the <b>newinstall/</b> directory.  This means that you can (and
have to) unzip the download and replace all the PHP code files, without
worrying about overwriting your customized config files.  However, for
every XML/PHP config file that was updated (see above), you <u>must</u>
replace your version with the one from the newinstall/ directory, or
compare them and <u>add</u> any new/changed configuration settings
to your version to insure the system remains working correctly.
<LI>For a new installation, go into the newinstall/ directory and
move all *.XML files into the main directory, next to aseco.php,
and *.PHP files into the includes/ directory.
